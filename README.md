## Deep Facial Recognition App with Siamese Neural Network

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to building a deep facial recognition system using a Siamese Neural Network (SNN). The SNN architecture is designed to learn and measure the similarity between pairs of facial images, making it highly effective for tasks such as face verification and recognition.

The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and includes a Jupyter notebook (`Faicial detectrecog.ipynb`) that walks you through the entire processâ€”from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment. The model leverages a custom contrastive loss function to optimize the distance between images of the same person and maximize it for images of different people.

### Key Features:
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Efficiently learns facial similarities for accurate face verification.
- **Custom Loss Function**: Employs contrastive loss to enhance model performance.
- **Real-Time Integration**: The model can be adapted for real-time facial recognition applications.

### Dataset:
The facial recognition model is trained on a well-curated dataset, which you can download from [here]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yL3SgY7QnAmqYiy4DQvlrIHXFbf2vII7/view?usp=sharing))

### Reference Paper:
The approach and methodology are inspired by the research paper *"Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition"*. You can read the paper [here]([https://example-paper-link.com](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)).
